      <description>Hi guys, welcome to today&amp;rsquo;s live video. Thanks for joining me. I want to talk today about stuff that I was writing about in my journal this morning. When you think about something which is important to you, something that you want to achieve, it can be anything really, it might be a new job, or maybe you&amp;rsquo;re planning to run a marathon, or give a presentation in front of maybe a hundred people.</description>
