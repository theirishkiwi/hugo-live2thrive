      <description>Hi, there! I think we&amp;rsquo;re live. Thank you for joining me again on today&amp;rsquo;s live video. Today, I want to talk about willpower and environment, and why one is better than the other, but keep watching to find out. Imagine a scenario where you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to give up sugar. You watched my video on nutrition and you know that sugary treats give you energy spikes followed by sugar crashes, which aren&amp;rsquo;t great.</description>
