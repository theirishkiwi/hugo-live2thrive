      <description>Hi, everyone, welcome to today&amp;rsquo;s live video. Thanks for joining me. Today I want to talk about a quote that I saw this week on a television show and it was called, &amp;ldquo;Today, not someday.&amp;rdquo; It got me thinking back to, well, why not today? Why many of us think including myself, think that dreaming of doing things someday, is actually more attractive than taking action today.</description>
